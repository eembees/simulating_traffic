# App for simulating Traffic Flow According to Different Models 
I am using this app to model traffic flow problems as taught in Namiko Mitarai's course in Diffusive and Stochastic Processes at the Niels Bohr Institute in 2020. 
Hope this will be able to help someone understand the traffic models better!

I will begin by simulating some models for traffic flow on single lane highways and update it as I go along, to perhaps add intersections and whatnot. 
## Usage 
Go to the website for the app and click the sidebar to use the different models.
